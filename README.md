## Hello, I'm Kadir Acaroglu! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computer science student with a strong interest in back-end development and web development, but I do various projects motivated by my academic curriculum and my personal curiosity.

- Languages:
  - Java (7/10)
  - C (4/10)
  - Dart + Flutter (Currently learning)
  - JavaScript (6/10)
    
- I'm currently working on:
  - Learning Dart and flutter to create mobile applications
  - Learning Node.js to expand my back-end development skills

- Fun Facts:
  - I create 3D characters/animations and work on Blender-related content as a hobby.
  - I should probably drink less coffee and watch less anime. :)

You can contact me anytime on acaroglugoktan@gmail.com!
